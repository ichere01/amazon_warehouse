COMPILE WITH CLANG
    The warehouse will be represented by two queues: a Retriever and a Packager.
The retriever will serve to initially take in all the orders through cin. The
head of the retriever queue will represent the item currently being retrieved.
The Packager queue will recieve orders that have been retrieved. The head of the
packager queue will be the Order being packaged.  In order to be able to 
increase the number of packagers in the future,  Packagers will be organized in
a static array. This organization will also make comparison between
waiting times in Packaging queues easy.
   Once an order has been retrieved, the Retrieval class will send a bool value
to main that will let it know that the order at the head of the retrieval queue
should be removed and added to the appropriate Packager.  This will be done 
through a manager function in main that will have 3 purposes: to determine which
queue a normal order should go to, to determine which queue a supreme order 
should go to, and finally to remove from the Retriever class and add to the 
shortest Packager.
